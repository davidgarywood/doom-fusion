# doom-fusion

This is an archive of where I left off, with my Doom source port, in the late 90s, with some additional documentation and things from Len Pitre. It was also heavily influenced by Rez who beta tested what I was building.

You won't find amazing code from me here. I was learning. I'm also very unlikely to ever find the time to do anything with it ever again.

Those were great times, and they were what got me started as a developer.
