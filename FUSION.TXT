David Wood - Decided to drag this from an old disk, and put it up on Github for posterity.

Len if you're still out there, I'd love to hear from you ! (contact@lightbeamapps.com)

L. Pitre: Actually got up the incentive to do a release. It's as done
as it's going to get. How to use it: Put it in your Doom directory,
in general it's going to work just like Boom or MBF. Indeed, you could
rename the EXE to boom.exe or mbf.exe and batch files/editors/Windows
wouldn't even notice. (The odds of Fusion not working on Boom-friendly
system is about 1/1000, at a guess.)

Demos of the special effects available, like the low-grav linedef and
the new codepointers, in textdemo.zip

(Below is the coder (David Wood's) "recent" changelog, as complete as 
I can get it.)

Backed out the mlook firing aiming code...it fekked up the
auto-aiming code :) Should get it sorted soon.

Re-added in the 'shooters' (mobj#'s 10131) from february,
should get a test wad for them made again soon.


9/21/1999

* Preliminary Mlook Code is back, jumping code is back.
* Support for SMMU's extended sector flags (bits 10/11 if I recall
correct) has been added; these affect sound activations in sectors
* In test is Len's SkillJump codepointer, to let the skill setting
affect which frame a mobj jumps to.
* Comment lines in DEH can now be started with a / 
this allows for C-style comments (// heh ;)

The revised code for this is: 

void A_SkillJump(mobj_t *actor) // 9/21/1999 Hakx
{
  if (gameskill <= sk_easy);
    {
      P_SetMobjState(actor, actor->state->misc1);
      return;
    }

  if (gameskill >= sk_hard);
    {
      P_SetMobjState(actor, actor->state->misc2);
      return;
    }
}


Unfortunately, somehow, someway, this doesn't actually appear to work
and I have no idea how it doesn't work yet...still investigating now.
The DEH I have been using to test it is this:

###########
Frame 454
Unknown 1 = 440
Unknown 2 = 554

[CODEPTR]
FRAME 454 = SkillJump
###########

It appears to be using 440 whatever the skill -shame, but I'll track
it down tommorrow, need sleep atm :)

Next on my list of things to do is some of the Mordeth related stuff;
weather FX and water fx. Water FX is pretty much highest on my priority
out of the two.

After running with a segVIOL in DOS in the last build, I have cleaned things
up ALOT, and now the only things that exist in this build are:
* the bugfixes
  -MBF/ORIG Invisibility
  -ALL Projectiles can't activate lifts
  -Render no-texture 1s wall as passble 2s wall
  -nonstat of the vissprite to work-around poss DJGPP mem bug.
* the codepointers
  -all the fusion-unique codepointers (including the special ones created
   by Len Pitre)
  -NB: Documentation of these will be included in the next build; otherwise
   see prev. build's docs.
* the Translucency Table fx
  -different things can now have a different tranmap for their percentage
   of translucency; thus enabling wad authors to control all the looks of
   the things in their levels. See TRANTEST.ZIP

-- NOTES:
Any bugs, PLEASE report. The jumping code/mlook code will be left out until
further coding of actual level/wad authoring features are completed; I think
it is the mlook code that is 'breaking' builds atm, and would prefer to make
some headway in other areas before returning to it.
Features/Bugfixes to be checked into for the next beta are:
-the MBF trigger bugs
-Z-clipping
-Hexen/ZDoom map format (arg's 3-5, Z-coords for things set in map, etc).
